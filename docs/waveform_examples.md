# Waveform examples

These visuals are quick-look, **illustrative** waveforms and constellations that match the
modulation families covered by the simulator. They are intended for documentation and
communication (not as a numerical validation fixture).

## OOK (IM/DD)

## Notes

* These plots are generated from deterministic example symbol streams to keep docs stable.
* For full physics runs, see `src/fiber_link_sim/schema/examples/` and the pipeline docs in
  `docs/refs/phys_pipeline_usage.md`.
